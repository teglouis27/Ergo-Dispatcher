# Ergo-Dispatcher
This is untested AI Slop for a dispatcher for managing the movement of trucks with the Golang library, Ergo.go
The goal would be to make a dispatcher tested by having a circle with three kinds of dots for warehouses, factories, and the trucks/ships/airplanes.
I don't have the financial resources or time to develop this myself. But I want it out there, because I think that completely open source logistics would make the world a better place.

You can run the main program to generate the circle by using:
go run main.go

You will need to be able to process an SVG.
go get github.com/ajstarks/svgo
